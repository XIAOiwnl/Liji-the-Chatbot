# Project Name: Chatbot Liji

## Problem
With the recent introduction of so many chatbots a major trend is the feeling of disconnectivity from both the real world and the users in the system’s response. To solve this problem we want to introduce a chatbot, nicknamed Liji, with a new prompting schema, which updates its responses according to outside information. We plan to prove that by adding additional sources such as weather api and calendar information into the prompt, Liji can comprehend the user's emotional state better than other baseline chatbots, which would lead to a more specific understanding of a user and higher quality responses. Liji will give more user-friendly responses than other chatbots. For example, most people tend to feel more relaxed when they have less time than usual or the weather is nice. Do such external factors change people’s attitude toward the chatbot? And can the chatbot predict how the user feels in a certain situation? We plan to answer these questions in our research.

## Evaluation plan
Blind experimental setup: To evaluate the model we plan on using a blind experimental setup with two sets of evaluation metrics, one with a in-test survey used to note the quality of the conversations with the participants, and one where participants are asked to evaluate the output of a control chat bot and Liji based on some predefined metrics (that we will define later in this proposal) and on a subject emotional connectivity metric after the each chat with the bots. We use these metrics as they are well defined in prior works and helpful to evaluate the research problem posed above. We ensure that our metrics are without bias by comparing to a control chat bot to account for any personal direction a participant would lean to.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
